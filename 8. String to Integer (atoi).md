# 8. String to Integer (atoi)

---

Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.

The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

1. Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (" ").
2. Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity if neither present.
3. Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.
4. Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be rounded to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be rounded to 231 - 1.
Return the integer as the final result.

## Test Cases

### Example 1:
Input: s = "42"
Output: 42

### Example 2:
Input: s = " -042"
Output: -42

### Example 3:
Input: s = "1337c0d3"
Output: 1337

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def myAtoi(self, s: str) -> int:
        s = s.lstrip() 
        if not s:
            return 0
        n = 0
        neg = False # flag to check if -ve
        index = 0
        if s[0] == '-': # if '-' hit, then neg = true
            neg = True
            index += 1
        elif s[0] == '+': # index is incremented only if there is a symbol
            index += 1
        
        while index < len(s) and s[index].isdigit(): # iterate until the string isn't empty or the character isn't a digit 
            n = n * 10 + int(s[index])
            index += 1
        
        if neg: # if negetive n is returned as -ve
            n = -n
        
        return min(max(-2**31,n), 2**31-1) # returning efficiently by considering the constraint given in problem description

# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

---

## Example Test Cases

### Example 1
- **Input**:  
  `s = "abcabcbb"`
- **Output**:  
  `3`
- **Explanation**:  
  The answer is `"abc"`, with the length of 3.

---

### Example 2
- **Input**:  
  `s = "bbbbb"`
- **Output**:  
  `1`
- **Explanation**:  
  The answer is `"b"`, with the length of 1.

---

### Example 3
- **Input**:  
  `s = "pwwkew"`
- **Output**:  
  `3`
- **Explanation**:  
  The answer is `"wke"`, with the length of 3. Notice that the substring must be continuous; `"pwke"` is not valid as it is a subsequence, not a substring.

## Solution
```python

class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s): # Two pointer solution
        a = set() # set is used for faster retrieval O(1)
        i = 0
        m = 0
        for j in range(len(s)): # String iter
            while s[j] in a: # To check if substring from i:j got repeating characters...
                m=max(m, len(a)) # if repeating character found then current j-i is compared for max with previous max and stores it as max 
                a.remove(s[i]) # adjust i and s for current substring
                i += 1
            a.add(s[j]) # add right pointer elements to set no matter what happens
        m=max(m, len(a)) # to check max for final element
        return m

Title: Reverse Words in a String
-----------------------------

Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the words. A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in `s` will be separated by at least one space. Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Solution:
---------

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        # Remove leading and trailing spaces
        s.lstrip()
        s.rstrip()
        
        # Split the string into words using the split() method
        l = s.split()
        
        # Reverse the order of the words in the list
        l = l[::-1]
        
        # Join the words back together using the " ".join() method
        s = " ".join(l)
        
        return s
```

Explanation:
-----------

The solution uses two methods to prepare the input string for reversal: `lstrip()` to remove any leading spaces, and `rstrip()` to remove any trailing spaces. Then, it splits the string into individual words using the `split()` method with no arguments (i.e., splitting on any character other than a space).

Next, it reverses the order of the words in the list using slicing (`l[::-1]`), and then joins the words back together using the `" ".join()` method. Finally, it returns the resulting string.

Note that the solution does not include any extra spaces in the returned string, as requested in the problem statement.

Code Example:
--------------

```python
# Test cases
print(reverseWords("the sky is blue")) # Output: "blue is sky the"
print(reverseWords("  hello world  ")) # Output: "world hello"
print(reverseWords("a good   example")) # Output: "example good a"
```

Additional Insights:
------------------

* The problem statement specifically requests that the returned string only have a single space separating the words. This is because the input string may contain leading or trailing spaces, and we want to remove any extra spaces in the reversed string.
* The solution uses the `split()` method with no arguments to split the input string into individual words. This means that any character other than a space will be treated as a word separator. If you wanted to use a different character as the word separator, you could modify the code accordingly (e.g., `s.split(None)`).

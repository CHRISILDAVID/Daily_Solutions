# 11. Container With Most Water

---

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

## Test Cases
![question_11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee315dea-46fb-4d47-a0b3-b666cfa00478)

### Example 1
- Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
- Output: 49
- Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

###Example 2:

- Input: height = [1,1]
- Output: 1

## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        m = float("-inf")
        i = 0 # left ptr
        j = len(height)-1 # right ptr
        high = max(height) # finding the max
        while i < j:
            m = max(m, min(height[i], height[j]) * (j-i)) # set m to the largest valid area
            if height[i] < height[j]: # ptrs are incremented and decremented based on height of the bar at their place
                i += 1
            else:
                j -= 1
            if high * (j-i) < m: # early stop if highest bar's area for the current width is lesser than m
                break
        return m

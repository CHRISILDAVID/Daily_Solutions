# 16. 3Sum Closest

---

Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.

Return the sum of the three integers.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

## Test Cases

### Example 1:

- Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
- Output: 2
- Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).


### Example 2:

- Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1
- Output: 0
- Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).

# Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def threeSumClosest(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        sol = float("+inf")
        nums.sort()
        for i in range(len(nums)-2): # i -> left to right
            if i >= 1 and nums[i-1] == nums[i]:
                continue
            j = i+1
            k = len(nums)-1
            while j < k: # j -> left to right and k -> right to left
                s = nums[i]+nums[j]+nums[k]
                if s == target:
                    return s
                if abs(sol - target) > abs(s - target): # closeness check
                    sol = s
                if s > target: # to update k
                    k -= 1
                else:
                    j += 1
        return sol

# 2. Add Two Numbers

---

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.


## Example Test Cases

### Example 1
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0115c907-9750-4ce2-89ee-67888a6b04b8)

- **Input**:  
  `l1 = [2,4,3]`  
  `l2 = [5,6,4]`
- **Output**:  
  `[7,0,8]`
- **Explanation**:  
  The numbers represented by the lists are `342` and `465`, and their sum is `807`. Reversing this gives `[7,0,8]`.

### Example 2
- **Input**:  
  `l1 = [0]`  
  `l2 = [0]`
- **Output**:  
  `[0]`

---

### Example 3
- **Input**:  
  `l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9]`  
  `l2 = [9,9,9,9]`
- **Output**:  
  `[8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]`

## Solution
```python

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: Optional[ListNode], l2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        l=ListNode()
        s = l
        c = 0
        while l1 != None and l2 != None: # Iterate when both lists aren't empty
            a = (l1.val + l2.val + c) # sum of current digit of both nums and the previous carry
            c = a // 10 # stores carry for the next iter
            s.next = ListNode(a % 10) # Next node created for solution list
            l1 = l1.next
            l2 = l2.next
            s = s.next
        # Same logic for all the leftover digits of the the two numbers(if exists)
        while l1 != None:
            a = (l1.val + c)
            c = a // 10
            s.next = ListNode(a % 10)
            s = s.next
            l1 = l1.next
        while l2 != None:
            a = (l2.val + c)
            c = a // 10
            s.next = ListNode(a % 10)
            s = s.next
            l2 = l2.next
        if c:
            s.next = ListNode(c)
        return l.next

# 1768. Merge Strings Alternately

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

## Example Test Cases

### Example 1:
- **Input:** `word1 = "abc"`, `word2 = "pqr"`
- **Output:** `"apbqcr"`

#### Example 2:
- **Input:** `word1 = "ab"`, `word2 = "pqrs"`
- **Output:** `"apbqrs"`

#### Example 3:
- **Input:** `word1 = "abcd"`, `word2 = "pq"`
- **Output:** `"apbqcd"`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        i = 0
        j = 0
        s = ""
        while i < len(word1) and j < len(word2): # if both strings exist at i and j respectively then add both characters at i and j to s
            s += word1[i] + word2[j]
            i += 1
            j += 1
        while i < len(word1): # add all the remaining characters of string 1
            s += word1[i]
            i += 1
        while j < len(word2): # add all the remaining characters of string 2
            s += word2[j]
            j += 1
        return s
